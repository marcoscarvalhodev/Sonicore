# Sonicore

The idea of this guitar store came from my passion for music, especially rock and metal genres. Although I am not a guitar specialist, or in creating high quality models yet, such as I used, I tried my best in finding good models and combining them with my three js and blender experiences for creating this website in the most optimal and accessible way. So for all music lovers, and users in general, I hope you can have a good experience with it.

## Features

**Play song when click on sound icon** - Right in the beginning it is possible to notice an icon sound that is muted/paused but if you want to activate it and play a random song that I've added, you only need to click it once to play, or if you want to pause then you click on it again.

**Move camera and guitar on scroll** - As you scroll through the website, you will realize that the camera setup in three js, will move along, but before you will be able to see the main guitar to also move and rotate for a great user experience.

**Choose guitar to look closely** - When you reach to the end of the website and only it will work if you are in the end or very close to it, you are able to click on one of the guitars that are in the guitar hanger on the wall and so it will come closer to the camera enabling you from playing with it, rotate and see more details of it. You will also notice that a descriptive text will appear, with two buttons, one for buying the guitar, and the other for placing it back on the hanger. Once you press one of the buttons, you will be able to scroll through the website again as I disabled scroll while one of the wall guitars is on focus.
